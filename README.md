# Conway's Game of Life

This is a variation of the Game of Life, implemented with Ruby on Rails, where each generation is requested via AJAX and gets entirely computed and rendered server-side so that the browser only needs to replace the grid in the DOM. On top I sprinkled some Stimulus.js to add just enough behavior to make it shine. If you look very closely you will also see Turbolinks in action. Oh... and by the way: the Asset Pipeline was exchanged for a complete Webpack setup, so no Sprockets have been harmed in delivering JavaScript and Stylesheets.

# TODO...
